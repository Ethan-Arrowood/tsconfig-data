# outFile

<!-- shortDescription -->
Concatenate and emit output to single file. The order of concatenation is determined by the list of files passed to the compiler on the command line along with triple-slash references and imports. See [output file order documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-control-file-ordering-in-combined-output---out-) for more details.
