<!-- extendedDescription -->
The `--build` flag builds your TypeScript project through Project References allowing the structure of the program to be broken up into smaller pieces. This is a new feature in TypeScript 3.0 and a complete guide can be found at the Project References documention in the references section. When enabled, use the `references` top-level property to specify project references.
