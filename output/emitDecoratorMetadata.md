# emitDecoratorMetadata

<!-- shortDescription -->
Emit design-type metadata for decorated declarations in source.

---

<!-- extendedDescription -->
This option is included in TypeScript for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators. Enable this with the `--experimentalDecorators` flag or a `--target` version that supports the decorator protocol. This metadata is best used with the `reflect-metadata` library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API. This option is experimental until metadata is adopted in ECMAScript standard.
