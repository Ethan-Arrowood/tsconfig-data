# sourceRoot

<!-- shortDescription -->
Specifies the location where debugger should locate TypeScript files instead of source locations. Use this flag if the sources will be located at run-time in a different location than that at design-time. The location specified will be embedded in the sourceMap to direct the debugger where the source files will be located.
