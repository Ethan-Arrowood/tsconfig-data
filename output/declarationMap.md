# declarationMap

<!-- shortDescription -->
Generates a sourcemap for each corresponding '.d.ts' file.
---

<!-- extendedDescription -->
This compiler option must be enabled along side `--declaration` and will cause the compiler to emit `.d.ts.map` files alongside the output of the `.d.ts` files. This is useful for developer tooling integration such as the go-to-definition feature in VS Code.
