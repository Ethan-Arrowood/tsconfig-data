# alwaysStrict

<!-- shortDescription -->
Parse in strict mode and emit "use strict" for each source file

---

<!-- extendedDescription -->
With this option enabled, all TypeScript code in the project will be parsed in ES5 strict mode, and the `"use strict"` statement will be placed at the top of all compiled output code. This option is automatically enabled when using the compiler option `--strict`. Read more on ES5 strict mode in the references section.
